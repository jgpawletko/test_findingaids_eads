            <p>The collection consists of the Sea Gate Sisterhood and Talmud Torah of Coney Island ledger. The ledger includes a history of the organization, meeting minutes, and financial records, dating from 1911 to 1923. Much of the ledger was recorded by Sigmund Spitzer, who served as secretary of the Talmud Torah of Coney Island.</p>

            <p>The Sea Gate Sisterhood was formed in 1911 by a group of women to support the local Jewish community and to raise funds for the construction of a synagogue in the Coney Island neighborhood of Brooklyn. In 1912, the Talmud Torah of Coney Island was organized by a "group of like-minded men," who worked in conjunction with the Sisterhood. The two groups organized a series of fundraisers, and construction of the synagogue commenced in 1917. The building was located at Mermaid Ave. and West 23rd St., and was subsequently demolished in the mid-20th century.</p>
            <p>Sophie Spitzer (born around 1862 in Austria-Hungary), was the primary organizer and first president of the Sea Gate Sisterhood. Her husband, Sigmund Spitzer (born around 1856 in Austria-Hungary), was a founding member of the Talmud Torah of Coney Island, and secretary of that organization.</p>
