            <p>Engine 41 was established in 1896, when the volunteer fire department of the former Town of New Utrecht was replaced with a paid department by the City of Brooklyn. A new firehouse was built on Bay Ridge Avenue, near Ridge Boulevard for use by Engine 41 and Ladder 13. In 1898, when Brooklyn was annexed by the Greater City of New York, Ladder 13 was disbanded, and its ladder truck was assigned to Engine 41. In 1899, all of the Brooklyn companies were renumbered, and Engine 41 became Engine 141. It was renumbered once more in 1913, when it became Engine 241. Combination Engine 241 was disbanded in 1914, along with five other companies, and reorganized as a single engine company.</p>
