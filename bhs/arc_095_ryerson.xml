            <p>The Ryerson family of Brooklyn descended from early Dutch settlers who immigrated to New Netherland as early as 1623. Marten Ryerson first came to New Amsterdam around 1647. He arrived with his brother Adriaen and they settled in Flatbush, now a neighborhood in Brooklyn. The Ryerson brothers operated a large farm that ran along what is now Flatbush Avenue.</p>
            <p>On May 14, 1663, Marten Ryerson married Annetje Joris de Rapelje in the Protestant Dutch Reformed Church of Brooklyn. Annetje was the daughter of Joris Jansen de Rapelje and Catalina de Rapelje (nee Tricot). The Rapeljes were one of the first Dutch families to settle in Fort Orange in 1623. Fort Orange was one of the two original Dutch trading posts that were located in what is now Albany, N.Y. From Fort Orange, the Rapelje family moved first to New Amsterdam and then across Wallabout Bay, now Upper New York Bay, to Wallabout, the area of land extending eastward into Brooklyn from Wallabout Bay. Today, Wallabout would include the DUMBO and Vinegar Hill neighborhoods of Brooklyn. In addition to being the first area settled by Europeans in Brooklyn, Wallabout was also the site of the first ferry landing between Manhattan and Brooklyn in 1637.</p>
            <p>Several generations later, John and Jacob Ryerson inherited family farmland in Wallabout. The brothers also owned farmland in Flatlands on New Lots Road near Kings Highway. Also, a Ryerson family homestead was located on what is now the Parade Grounds in Prospect Park.</p>
            <p>Variations of the Ryerson family name include Adriance, Martense, Ryers, and Ryerse.</p>
