            <p>First day covers are a particular type of stamp collecting. A first day cover consists of an envelope or postcard (the “cover”) with an attached special issue stamp cancelled on the stamp’s first date of sale by the Post Office in the designated first day city (a location usually related to the stamp subject). First day covers often include a cachet, a pictorial design, and in some instances, informational text that complement the subject of the related stamp. Modern first day covers are typically not addressed and must include a First Day of Issue postmark or cancellation.</p>

            <p>The collection comprises 142 U.S. first day covers (136 envelopes and 6 postcards) with Brooklyn-related subjects issued during the period 1951-2014. The bulk of the collection consists of first day covers created in 1983 to mark the 100th anniversary of the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge. The remaining first day covers commemorate the Battle of Brooklyn, also known as the Battle of Long Island (1951), the opening of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge (1964), and the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Yankees baseball rivalry (1999). Notable individuals represented in the collection include U.S. Representative Shirley Chisholm (2014) and the poet Marianne Moore (1990). The first day covers in this collection each include a cachet with designs ranging from simple black and white drawings to color silk-screen artwork and, in some instances, informational text.</p>
