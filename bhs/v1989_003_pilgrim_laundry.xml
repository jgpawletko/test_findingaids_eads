            <p>Pilgrim Laundry opened in Brooklyn, N.Y. in 1894. The founders, James Edwin Dann and Edward Huff Bancker set out to open a laundry business based on the belief that the business would flourish if workers were given fair labor standards. In 1910, a fire destroyed the original laundry building. In 1913, Pilgrim Laundry was able to open a new plant in the Windsor Terrace neighborhood of Brooklyn that included recreation facilities and a vacation clubhouse for employees. In 1921, the company began to allow employees to buy stock in the company and by 1937 over 50% of the company was employee-owned. When Bancker died in 1939, his stock shares were also bought by employees giving them 75% ownership. By the 1950s, Pilgrim Laundry was entirely employee-owned with their services reaching all four counties of Long Island, as well as Westchester County. Pilgrim Laundry was later acquired by another firm. Under the practices of the new ownership, Pilgrim Laundry went out of business in the 1960s.</p>
