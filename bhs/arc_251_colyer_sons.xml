            <head>Biographical note</head>
            <p>Joseph H. Colyer was born circa 1848 in New York to Abram and Bernah Colyer. He was a lifetime resident of Brooklyn, New York. In the 1870s he was involved in the real estate business, working for the Bulkley &amp; Horton Company. According to a receipt found in this collection, by 1877 Colyer became a dealer in coal and wood. He had formerly worked for, and became successor to, J.F. Muchmore's business. That same year he resided at 321 Myrtle Avenue. Colyer's business would later become Joseph H. Colyer &amp; Son by the 1890s, which operated as a contracting firm dealing in masons' building materials, coal, and wood that was in operation during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Originally located at the foot Washington Street (with an office at 95 Plymouth Street), the firm later relocated to a yard at Fulton and Front Streets.</p>
            <p>Joseph married Harriet Colyer in 1877. He had one son, also named Joseph H., and two daughters, Hattie and Hazel. He is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery.</p>
