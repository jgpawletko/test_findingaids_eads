                <emph render="bold">Richard Rosenblum</emph> (circa 1928-) was an American author and illustrator. He was born in Brooklyn (N.Y.), around 1928, and later graduated from Cooper Union. He was an author and illustrator of several children's books, many of which documented the Jewish experience in 20th century Brooklyn.</p>

                <emph render="bold">Norman Rosten</emph> (1913-1995) was an American poet, playwright, and novelist. He was born on January 1, 1913, in New York City and was raised in Hurleyville, NY. He graduated from Brooklyn College (1931-1935), New York University (1936), and the University of Michigan (1937-1938), where he won the Avery Hopwood Award for his drama and poetry. He returned to New York in 1939, and was named a winner in the Yale Series of Younger Poets in 1940. In 1941, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. His work was published and performed from the 1940s to the 1980s. His poetry was published in The New Yorker, and his play, "Mister Johnson," opened on Broadway in 1956. As a longtime resident of Brooklyn, the borough was prominently featured in his later work. In 1979, he was named poet laureate of Brooklyn. He was married to Hedda Rosten from 1938, until her death in 1984. He died in Brooklyn on March 7, 1995.</p>
