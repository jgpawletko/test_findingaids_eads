The cards represent Wainio's time in Grade 3A at PS 131 and Grades 3B through 8A at PS 179. They were signed by his mother or his father each month on the back of the card. The report cards indicate the courses and grades of a Finnish immigrant during a significant portion of their educational career.

            <head>Biographical note</head>
            <p>George John Wainio was born in Brooklyn, New York on August 15, 1905. His mother was Luveisa (maiden name Kosala). His father was John Wainio. Both parents were born in Finland and immigrated to America. When George was 4, the family moved back to Finland for a year, returning to Brooklyn when George was 5, sailing in to Ellis Island. George was the oldest of three brothers, Walter, who died in infancy, Eino, who died when he was 8 years old, and Albert, who is 10 years younger than George. During his childhood, George would spend some summers in Cranberry, New Jersey with some relatives. He attended PS 131 (located on Fort Hamilton Avenue, between 43rd Street and 44th Street) and PS 179 (located on Avenue C, between East 2nd Street and East 3rd Street) for his early education. In 1920, when he was 15, George moved to a house in Fremont, New York, which has remained in the family ever since. Around 1940, George legally changed his last name to Wayne. He passed away on September 2, 1986 at the age of 81.</p>
