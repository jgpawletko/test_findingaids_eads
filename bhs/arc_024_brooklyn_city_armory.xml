Items in the collection provide a picture of the social, cultural, and political climate of Brooklyn in the late 1850s.</abstract>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>This collection, dated 1850 to 1930, includes books, printed materials, newspapers, and ephemera of various Brooklyn institutions, including city offices, fire squads, Masonic lodges, social clubs, and militia regiments, all originating from the 1850s. Oversize documents from the collection include a diagram of the New York State Assembly Chamber and autographs of U.S. President James Buchanan, New York Governor John A. King, Brooklyn Mayor Samuel S. Powell, and several other notables at the time of the cornerstone ceremony in 1858.</p>
            <p>Photographs in the collection include military photographs and portraits of local and national politicians, presumably originating from the box laid into the armory's cornerstone, and images of the demolition of the armory cornerstone in 1930.</p>

            <head>Historical note</head>
            <p>The Brooklyn City Armory, also known as the Henry Street Armory, was constructed in 1858 at the corner of Henry Street and Cranberry Street in Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn, N.Y. The "new" armory replaced a structure which previously served as Brooklyn City Hall and was also used as an armory prior to demolition. The 13th and 14th regiments of the New York State Militia, both of which fought in the Civil War, were headquartered in the armory.</p>
            <p>The armory's cornerstone was laid in the summer of 1858 and held a sealed lead box with items that depicted activities of the day. Several Brooklyn Heights and Williamsburg-based Masonic lodges, fire companies, social clubs, and regiments of the Militia placed member rolls, by-laws, and constitutions in the box, along with City of Brooklyn ephemera and New York City newspapers from the summer of 1858. The armory was demolished in 1930, and the box was recovered by A. W. Steele, manager of the Cranlyn Apartments at the neighboring 80 Cranberry Street.</p>
