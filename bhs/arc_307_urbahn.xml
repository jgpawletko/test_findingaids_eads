            <p>A. Urbahn and his family immigrated from Germany to New Jersey beginning in the late 19th century, although they periodically returned to Germany before permanently settling in the United States in 1889. They later moved to Brooklyn, possibly following a conflict with a business partner. The family operated the textile manufacturing business A. Urbahn's Sons, which produced a variety of textiles and garments. The
