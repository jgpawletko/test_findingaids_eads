After his death in 1919, Mildred settled his business debts and the store was closed. She married Irving Drucker around 1920 or 1921; they owned several rental properties including 1007 and 1009 Flushing Avenue – 1007 had been the location of Wolf’s Shoes. The retail space of 1009 was rented out to M. Berman Hardware.</p>
            <p>Helen Wolf (daughter of Mildred Wolf Drucker) graduated from Brooklyn College in 1937. As a student, she founded the campus House Plan Association (HPA). She later became a psychologist, working at the Community School (a private school) and elsewhere.</p>
            <p>Amy Schlagel (daughter of Helen Wolf Schlagel) was a graduate student at the Graduate School of Architecture and Planning, Columbia University, in the mid-1970s.</p>
