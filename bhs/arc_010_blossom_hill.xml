Items include travel journals to Europe by Josephine Hill and Mary Hill; correspondence, news clippings, diaries, and recipe books belonging to Sarah Hill Blossom; printed material collected by the Blossom family, including programs from the Church of the Savior in Brooklyn Heights; and news clippings from the period, such as the statement by Ulysses S.
