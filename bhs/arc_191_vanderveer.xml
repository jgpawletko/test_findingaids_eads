            <p>Adrian Vanderveer Martense (1852-1898) was an amateur photographer who was a descendent of early Dutch settlers in Brooklyn. The Martense family were longtime residents of Flatbush, one of the original six towns of Brooklyn and today a neighborhood in the borough of Brooklyn comprised of numerous smaller neighborhoods including Midwood, Ditmas Park, Fiske Terrace, Beverly Square (East and West), Prospect Park South, Caton Park, and Albemarle-Kenmore Terraces. In Flatbush, the Martense family built a homestead which included land that is now part of Green-Wood Cemetery. The Martense homestead stood for several generations until the family sold it in 1889, when Flatbush was transitioning from a farming community into an inner suburb.</p>
            <p>For Adrian Vanderveer Martense, Flatbush became a subject for his photography. Martense documented houses, streets, and his friends and neighbors in Flatbush, as well as momentous events such as the Blizzard of 1888. Martense was a member of the Brooklyn Academy of Photography (which became the Brooklyn Camera Club in 1896) and served as its first recording secretary when it was established in 1887.</p>

                    <p>This series consists of two photographs albums compiled by Martense from his own photography.</p>
                    <p>The Blizzard of 1888 photograph album primarily contains scenes of Flatbush, Brooklyn after the blizzard. The photographs are albumen prints and are mounted onto the pages of the album. Bound into the album is a letter written to Martense by W. L. Keese. Keese was a subject in at least one of Martense's photographs and seems to have been a neighbor.</p>
                    <p>The second photograph album, 1886 to 1888, contains photographs of Martense's neighborhood in Flatbush including views looking out from Martense's house; informal portraits of his Flatbush neighbors (many are outside shots); views of Prospect Park; and exterior and interior views of houses in his neighborhood.</p>
