            <head>Biographical note</head>
            <p>Walter A. Carley was born circa 1900 and grew up in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn, N.Y. He completed his childhood schooling and confirmation at St. Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Church and School on Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint in June, 1907. Carley then attended St. John's College, now St. John's University, in Brooklyn from 1907-1909. He served in World War I as a Navy seaman and storekeeper at St. Julian's Creek in Portsmouth, VA from 1918-1919. An honorable discharge followed in 1921.</p>
            <p>As an active member of the Knights of Columbus (K of C), Lexington Council, No. 293, based in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Carley served as the chair of multiple publicity and advertising committees. He was also an active member of the Greenpoint Peoples Regular Democratic Organization (GPRDO). This political organization fostered Regular Democratic values and promoted the Regular Democratic agenda throughout Brooklyn. The Regular Democrats tended to be conservative in apposition to Reform Democrats who espoused to be against the democratic "machine" of city, state and local government. Carley is cited on the website, 
                <emph render="italic">The Political Graveyard</emph>, as a Brooklyn Delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1940, 1944, and 1948. It is unclear if politics served as Carley's sole profession. Also included in the collection are personal records of Carley's father, Edward Carley, relating to his plumbing business in Brooklyn and the confirmation certificate from St. Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Church for Emily Carley, his sister.</p>
            <p>Walter A. Carley died in 1956. His funeral was held at St. Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Church in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.</p>

The photographs include images of Carley, group photographs and a portrait of Rose M. Casey. The picture postcards mostly pertain to the K of C Institute in Brooklyn.</p>

                    <p>The materials in this series date from 1917-1931, however the bulk of the materials date from 1919-1928. This series also contains undated materials. Included in the series are financial records and correspondence from the Knights of Columbus, Lexington Council, No. 293 journal and publicity committee, which Carley chaired in 1928. Carley also collected newspaper clippings relating to Knights of Columbus (K of C) events, from 1923-1929. Additionally, there are programs from K of C theater events, balls, dinners, brunches and religious events that comprise the bulk of the series. The programs include local business advertisements, as well as, names of local K of C members that provide a snapshot of Greenpoint from the 1920s through the 1940s. The K of C, Lexington Council, No. 293, of which Carley was a member, sponsored many of the events noted in the programs. However, the series contains a representative sample of materials from other Brooklyn, Long Island, and New York state chapters. Carley also collected multiple issues of various K of C chapter periodical bulletins. Two copies of the K of C publication, 
                        <emph render="italic">Columbia</emph>, have been placed with the oversized materials.</p>
