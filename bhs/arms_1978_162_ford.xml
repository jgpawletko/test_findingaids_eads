            <p>Assembled for a 1974 Long Island Historical Society (known today as Brooklyn Historical Society) exhibition, the collection contains papers and photographs relating to the Ford family. The bulk of the collection consists of 20th century fascimiles of original papers, the content of which dates back to the 1850s.</p>
            <p>The papers include biographical pieces on various members of the Ford family, as well as correspondence, clippings, and writings. The collection includes numerous portraits of the Ford family, dating from circa 1850s to the 1920s. Some of these portraits include the interior of the Ford family residence, which was located at 97 Clark Street in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. Exhibition records included in the collection consist of oversize clippings and a press release announcing the opening of "The Fords of Clark Street" exhibition.</p>
            <p>The collection also contains one ledger from an unidentified Brooklyn school. The ledger contains listings of students, with their date of admission, parents' names, residence, class number, teacher's name, and date of dismissal. The students all appear to have lived in the Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens neighborhoods of Brooklyn. The ledger dates from 1869 to 1874.</p>
