            <p>Samuel Brody was born around Kaunas, Lithuania, in about 1880. His wife, Lillian ("Lily") Brody, was also born in this area around 1890. Samuel immigrated to New York City in 1906, where he met and married Lily. Both were of Jewish descent. For a time they lived at 75 Johnson Avenue, in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, and later moved to 79 Johnson Avenue. Samuel became a naturalized citizen in 1928. He worked in the garment industry for most of his life. They had two sons, Israel George Brody and David Allan Brody. Samuel died in 1940, followed by Lily in 1955.</p>
            <p>Israel George Brody (later he legally shortened his name to "George Brody") was born in Brooklyn on December 4, 1913. He was a graduate of Isaac Remsen Junior High School (1927) and the Eastern District High School. He then attended the City College of New York (Class of 1942). After graduating from CCNY, he moved to Detroit and then attended the University of Michigan Law School (Class of 1947). He later attended New York University, eventually obtaining a Master of Law degree in taxation. He was appointed a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge for the Eastern District of Michigan around 1960, a position he held until retirement in 1988. After retirement, he continued to work as a bankruptcy judge in San Diego on a part-time basis. He never married. He died on March 6, 2008.</p>
            <p>David Allan Brody was born in Brooklyn on June 24, 1916. He was a graduate of Isaac Remsen Junior High School (1930) and Boys' High School (1932). He attended the City College of New York (Class of 1936) and then Columbia Law School (Class of 1940). He moved to Washington DC, and then married Beatrice Kramer in 1943. He served in the Navy during World War II, and after the war was hired by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in 1949. In 1965 he was appointed Washington Director, serving as the chief lobbyist for the ADL. He retired in 1989, and died on June 26, 2004.</p>
