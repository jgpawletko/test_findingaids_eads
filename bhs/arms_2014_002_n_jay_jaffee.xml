            <p>Nathan Jaffee was born in Brooklyn, NY, in 1921. He was the third child of Isidore and Anna Jaffee, who were Russian and Polish Jewish immigrants. They first lived on Georgia Avenue, in Brownsville, before moving to other neighborhoods of Brooklyn, including Bensonhurst and Crown Heights. His mother died when he was 14. Jaffee then left school and worked as a typesetter, before being drafted into service during World War II. There he served as an infantry squad leader and saw heavy combat. Around 1947, he married and began photographing his surroundings in Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Long Island. He later began his formal training under the tutelage of Sid Grossman (of the Photo League) and Edward Steichen (curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Art). While working on his photography, he continued to work in the printing industry. He later left Brooklyn, and lived in Huntington, Long Island.</p>
            <p>His work was exhibited at numerous museums and galleries around the world, including the Brooklyn Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian Institution, the National Portrait Gallery, the Library of Congress, the National Museum of American Art, the New York Public Library, the Brooklyn Public Library, the Bibliotheque nationale de France, the International Museum of Photography and Film (George Eastman House), the Museum of Fine Arts (Boston), and the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University. A book of his photographs, 
                <emph render="italic">N. Jay Jaffee: Photographs 1947–1956</emph>, was published in 1976.</p>
            <p>He was married to Isabel Jaffee, and had two daughters, Anna and Cyrisse. He died in 1999, and was survived by his children and his long-time companion, Paula Hackerling.</p>
