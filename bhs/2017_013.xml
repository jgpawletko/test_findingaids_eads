    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection contains postcards of Prospect Park, Erasmus Hall High School, and miscellaneous buildings in Brooklyn. The postcards of Prospect Park vary from depicting the entrances and monuments to the Park, the boathouse, lake, and bridges, and the flower garden and zoo. There are also many postcards that contain scenic depictions of the park as a whole. </p><p>The miscellaneous postcards include images of the Brooklyn Botanical Garden, a rendering of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, and the edifices of the 23rd Regiment Army, Greenwood Cemetary, and Pratt Institute. </p><p>The collection also contains postcards of Erasmus Hall High School. Those that are dated are dated between 1908-1929. The majority of the postcards of Erasmus Hall High School depict the outside of the building, as well as the original building from 1787, with one documenting an event called "The Indian Episode" at the school's 125th anniversary. Several of the postcards contain writing on the back detailing those individuals' visits to Erasmus Hall.</p>  </scopecontent>
