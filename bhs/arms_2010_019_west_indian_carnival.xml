    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The West Indian Carnival tradition in New York City stems from private gatherings and parties held in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan in the 1920s, typically in February. In the 1940s, an outdoor street festival began taking place on 7th Avenue in Harlem, organized by Trinidadian Jessie Wattle. In 1967, the Carnival was moved to Eastern Parkway in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn following a disturbance that led to its street permit being revoked in Manhattan. At this same time, the West Indian American Day Carnival Association (WIADCA) was founded. The Association was run by Trinidadian Carlos Lezama from 1967 until 2001, and was later headed by his daughter, Yolanda Lezama-Clark. With Thomas Bailey serving as President since 2012, the West Indian Carnival in Brooklyn is now one of the largest outdoor street festivals in North America. </p><p>Carnival activities begin on the Thursday before Labor Day and continue through Monday, concluding with the parade itself. Other events and activities include a steel band competition and a Kiddie Carnival. The parade itself takes months of preparation from each masquerade camp or "mas," which designs its own elaborate and colorful costumes around a central theme and competes for prizes with the other camps. Parade participants are accompanied by various musical groups and styles, as well as food vendors, brought together to celebrate pan-Caribbean culture.</p><p>The Brooklyn Historical Society launched The West Indian Carnival Documentation Project in 1994 in cooperation with the West Indian American Day Carnival Association and the Brooklyn Museum with a goal of supplementing existing photographs and histories of the event with personal narratives and life histories of Carnival participants. Those involved with the project attempted to get different viewpoints within the hierarchy of Carnival organization and participation. The oral histories, photographs and resources that make up this collection were compiled by a team including two community researchers, photographers from local Caribbean publications, graduate student assistants, scholarly advisors and a community advisory committee primarily made up of WIADCA members. Staff for this project included Dwandalyn Reece King (Chief Curator), Michael Roberts (Interviewer), Joyce Quamina (Research Assistant), Megan McShea (Project Assistant), Maureen Mahon (Project Fieldworker) and Kristen Elmquist (Project Fieldworker).</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The West Indian Carnival Documentation Project records were largely kept in their original order. Series were formed based on format. The oral history transcripts, tapes, and digitized audio are arranged alphabetically. Each folder of photographs represents one reel of film and the photos remain in the order in which they were taken and developed. The folders are organized chronologically. The research materials are located in three boxes, the third of which contains oversized materials. The first two boxes are arranged alphabetically. </p><p>The collection is organized into the following four series.<emph render="bolditalic"> Series 1: Oral histories</emph> consists of digitized oral history interview recordings of most of the interviews. <emph render="bolditalic">Series 2: Oral history transcripts</emph> includes transcripts and cassette tapes of most of the interviews. The interview with Wesley Millington does not have a transcript. The Debra Holland interview was not preserved. Interview abstracts are located in the "Summaries" folder in box 2. </p><p>Many of the topics and people discussed in the oral history interviews are also represented in <emph render="bolditalic">Series 3: Photographs</emph>. When available, these are included in the folder title as well as the series scope and content note. The photos document the Parade itself, in addition to the organizers and participants, costumes, music, instruments, rehearsals and Carnival preparation in general. Though the majority of the series is made up of 4 x 6 color prints, there are also some corresponding negatives, contact sheets, and a few larger prints. </p><p><emph render="bolditalic">Series 4: Research materials</emph> is made from what was gathered and generated through the documentation project. The materials relate directly to the West Indian Carnival in Brooklyn, as well as to Carnivals in London and Trinidad. They also describe the pan-Caribbean community in and outside of Brooklyn. This series includes magazines, newspapers, pamphlets, articles, bibliographies and resource lists, and ephemeral materials. </p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Oral History note</head>
<p>Oral history interviews are intimate conversations between two people, both of whom have generously agreed to share these recordings with the Brooklyn Historical Society archives and with researchers. Please listen in the spirit with which these were shared. Researchers will understand that:</p><p>1. The Brooklyn Historical Society abides by the General Principles &amp; Best Practices for Oral History as agreed upon by the Oral History Association (2009) and expects that use of this material will be done with respect for these professional ethics.</p><p>2. Every oral history relies on the memories, views and opinions of the narrator. Because of the personal nature of oral history, listeners may find some viewpoints or language of the recorded participants to be objectionable. In keeping with its mission of preservation and unfettered access whenever possible, BHS presents these views as recorded.</p><p>3. Transcripts created prior to 2008 serve as a guide to the interview and are not considered verbatim. The audio recording should be considered the primary source for each interview. It may contain natural false starts, verbal stumbles, misspeaks, repetitions that are common in conversation, and other passages and phrases omitted from the transcript. This decision was made because BHS gives primacy to the audible voice and also because some researchers do find useful information in these verbal patterns.</p><p>4. Unless these verbal patterns are germane to your scholarly work, when quoting from this material researchers are encouraged to correct the grammar and make other modifications maintaining the flavor of the narrator's speech while editing the material for the standards of print.</p>  </otherfindaid>

She reflects on the experience of Carnival and considers the economic resources the Carnival annually brings to New York City. She notes that the contributions of the Caribbean community have not been fully acknowledged by the government or the media. Alexander suggests that WIADCA should be a year round institution that can serve the community; providing resources for job training and employment and addressing the need of the organization to involve more people from other Caribbean islands. She also discusses the cultural conflicts that have occurred among organizers and finishes with a description of the activities and services provided by the non-profit Caribbean-American Center, of which WIADCA was an affiliate.

A native of Trinidad, he has been in the United States since 1964. Recognized as a prodigy in art and mathematics, his architectural/design career began by designing steel pans. As a child, he found that Carnival in Trinidad was his opportunity to practice and display his artistic skills. His career has been spent as an architect and carnival designer. Evelyn's first job in the States was with Standard Oil. As late as 2010, he remained a vocal proponent of Carnival as a meaningful cultural event for Brooklyn.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_b6e1f09b0647f038d9f4317dede9aec0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In the interview, Terry Evelyn speaks very strongly about issues of culture, Carnival, race and ethnicity. He begins by remembering his own personal origin weaved in with his early participation in Trinidad's Carnival. Evelyn compares his experience with the judging process for that event with the process in Brooklyn's Carnival. He discusses mounting a presentation for Nelson Mandela's visit to the United Nations that couldn't be executed. He recalls his early participation and the stakeholders involved with Brooklyn's early Carnivals. In 1994, Evelyn was in high demand for his designs and consulting work in several North American Carnivals and he relates details about that. He bemoans that Carnival could be turned into a parade of nudity. Evelyn discusses his architectural design for a proposed performance space in Trinidad. His culturally diverse approach to that is contextualized with the diversity of Brooklyn Carnival. He digresses several times in the last half-hour; taking on several weighty issues, revealing some intolerance and theorizing on conspiracies relating to Jewish influence, war, liberty, and the oppression of African Americans and Caribbean Americans.

He grew up in Trinidad but later returned to Venezuela, where he was an auto-worker for General Motors and Chrysler, as well as a mechanic in Caracas specializing in dental machinery. After that, he departed for a job as a merchant mariner. It was during his travels as a seaman that he first visited the United States and eventually resolved to move to New York City, which he did—alone—in 1954. He lived in Manhattan first before moving to the Brooklyn neighborhood of Crown Heights. At some point, his wife and children joined him; they were all congregants at Saint Gregory Catholic Church. He continued to work as a mechanic, taking vocational courses to supplement his training, and after a while was able to buy a home on St. John's Place. During this time, he became a prominent figure in the cultural life of Crown Heights' West Indian residents. Along with Rufus (Lionel) Gorin, he was a key organizer of the first Carnival on Labor Day that went down Eastern Parkway, now commonly called the West Indian Day Parade, in 1969. When Gorin died, Lezama was elected the first president of the West Indian American Day Carnival Association (WIADCA)—a position to which he was repeatedly reelected until he retired in 2002. He died in 2007.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_78d869d43a879c6644eb36e2a4644d3c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Lezama, who in 1994 was in his twenty-eighth year as president of the West Indian-American Day Carnival Association (WIADCA), recounts the history of the Carnival and his personal involvement with it. He explains the relocation of the Carnival from Harlem to the Brooklyn neighborhood of Crown Heights and its transformation from a small affair, held mostly indoors in the middle of winter, to a late-summer street festival attracting millions of spectators and participants. He compares the Brooklyn Carnival with its analogues throughout the Caribbean and the United States, especially Trinidad. He describes WIADCA's relationship with city government and the police; both in the aftermath of the 1991 Crown Heights unrest and more recently amid an NYPD "crackdown" on "quality of life" offenses that has affected Carnival participation. He dwells on a dispute with the Hasidim of Crown Heights over the date of the 1994 Carnival, which Lubavitcher Jews claimed would conflict with the holiday of Rosh Hashanah, and how minority-focused newspapers have commented on it.

He describes his initial impression of the West Indian American Day festivities in Harlem, New York in the 1940s and the events leading to the inception of the West Indian American Day Carnival and its parent association in Brooklyn. Dr. Stanislaus discusses the planning process of the Carnival. In 1994, the Carnival coincided with the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah. This created a conflict between Carnival organizers and members of the Hasidic Jewish community of Crown Heights in Brooklyn. Dr. Stanislaus provides his opinion on this situation and that of the Crown Heights riot of 1991. He speculates on the potential political influence the Carnival raises and discusses how the event can be used to support charities in the community and around the world.
