            <p>Lindsay E. Adams was born in New York around 1869. By 1892, he had moved to Brooklyn, New York, and married Dora Mills Adams. They had four children: Hazel M. (Wolff), Virginia (Le Fevre), Frederick M., and George S. The family resided at 123 Lincoln Place, in the Prospect Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. Lindsay was involved in two trades: photography (he operated out of the family home in Prospect Heights) and the spice wholesale business (in Manhattan, New York). By 1907, the family had moved to 485 Rugby Road in the newly developed Ditmas Park neighborhood of Brooklyn.</p>

            <p>The Adams family photographs and papers consists of 95 cabinet card photographs, one tintype photograph, five pocket journals, one leather wallet, and 13 pieces of correspondence, postcards, and other ephemera. Many of the photographs were taken and developed by Lindsay E. Adams, who operated a photography business out of 123 Lincoln Place, in the Prospect Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, during the 1890s.</p>
            <p>Many of photographs document Brooklyn in the late 19th century. These include three photographs of the Blizzard of 1888, one photograph of the Brooklyn Bridge, one group portrait of the Prospect Heights Social Club of 1888, and twelve photographs of the interior of the Adams family home (most likely 123 Lincoln Place). Other photographs document Adams family vacations to Maine, upstate New York, and Colorado.</p>
            <p>In addition to photographs taken by Lindsay E. Adams, the collection also includes numerous cabinet card portraits taken by other studios in the late 19th century. It also includes published souvenir photographs, namely four photographs from a series entitled, "Stereoscopic Views of Lackawaxen, PA., photographed and published by L. Hensel, Port Jervis, N.Y."</p>
            <p>Non-photographic items include one membership card to the Aeolian Music Circulating Library (1899), 11 postcards, envelopes, and invitations made out to Mr. and Mrs. Lindsay E. Adams (1899-1900), and one souvenir booklet of postcards from St. Augustine, Florida (1912).</p>
            <p>Finally, the collection also contains five pocket journals which document Lindsay E. Adams's business in the spice wholesale trade in Manhattan, New York (1893-1899), and one leather wallet issued by the Boston Wholesale Grocers' Association (1896).</p>
