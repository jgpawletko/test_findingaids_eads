            <head>Biographical note</head>
            <p>Dale Oliver was born in New York on May 28, 1914, to George Oliver, an immigrant from Scotland, and Eleanor Kraft, whose father was an immigrant from Germany (a baker who lived in Brooklyn, New York). He had two siblings, Robert (born around 1911) and a younger brother who died of a contagious disease as an infant. In 1915, the family resided in Oyster Bay, on Long Island, and by 1925 they had relocated to Brooklyn. Dale attended the Bedford School, PS 3 at Bedford Avenue, graduating on June 26, 1929. He continued at the Brooklyn Technical High School, finishing there in 1933. He attended college briefly, then worked for restaurant equipment manufacturer.</p>
            <p>During World War II, the factory was retooled to make shell casings. Although he enlisted to fight in the war, he was never called to serve. He eventually worked at Revere Copper and Brass as a sales manager, specializing in aluminum products. Dale left Brooklyn sometime after he married Florence "Mickey" Schmueck, in August 1941, and before their first son, Robert was born in November 1942. They lived for a while in New City, New York, then relocated to Somers, New York around 1951. They had five children, Robert, John, Elizabeth, George, and Jeanne. Dale died in 1974 and Mickey became the Town Historian in Somers shortly after that, a position which she held until her death in May 2011.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>The collection consists of 20th century ephemera which belonged to Dale F. Oliver. It includes a railway token for the C.R. &amp; L. Lines, a dog tag for Dale Oliver, an unidentified service pin, a Brooklyn Vocational School pin from 1925, a metal dog license from Brooklyn 1941 issued by the A.S.P.C.A., a complaint letter from an anonymous neighbor to Oliver requesting he turn down his radio, Oliver's Brooklyn Technical High School diploma, a Brooklyn Technical High School yearbook from 1933 called "The Blue Print", and an autograph book for Bedford School, PS 3 from 1929.</p>
            <p>Overall the collection documents the student life of a second generation immigrant in Brooklyn, New York, during the 1920s and 1930s. The collection does not include any materials that provide greater insight into Dale Oliver’s life outside of his education and the information provided by the pins and token.</p>
