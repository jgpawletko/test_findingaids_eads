            <p>Gift from Karl Vogel, M.D., February 1967. Vogel's papers were donated to N-YHS as a complement to his principal donation, made at the same time, of the model of the 
                <emph render="italic">Constitution</emph> he constructed (likely accession 1967.8). The model was deaccessioned in June 2009.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
            <p>The collection includes drawings, photographs, notes, and correspondence related to Karl Vogel's construction in 1927 of a one-eighth inch to the foot scale model of the U.S. Frigate 
                <emph render="italic">Constitution</emph>. The correspondence primarily includes letters, many with drawings, from Lieutenant-Colonel William F. Spicer of the Navy. One detailed drawing of the 
                <emph render="italic">Constitution</emph> is titled "Key to running rigging, showing where belayed," which was copied from Spicer.</p>
            <p>There are many hand drawn sketches of copies of drawings of the sloop 
                <emph render="italic">Comet</emph> and other ships, perhaps especially of the rigging. These include copies of drawings and notes from H. Percy Ashley, a builder of rare ship models. The drawings include fine details of ships often with dimensions noted.</p>
            <p>Other reference material includes typescripts of letters written by Charles Edward Fleming on board the 
                <emph render="italic">Constitution</emph> in 1835-1837. There are also photographs of the U.S. frigate 
                <emph render="italic">Constitution</emph>, of a model of it, and of the 
                <emph render="italic">"Constitution</emph> as built for moving pictures." There are also three photographs of the U.S.S. 
                <emph render="italic">Constellation.</emph></p>
