The packets are often distinctive in that they refer to particular business establishments, especially hotels and restaurants, institutions, and some events, notably the World's Fairs of 1939-40 and of 1964-65 and the 1980 Winter Olympics.</abstract>

            <p>Clive Probert, the collection donor, began collecting sugar packets about 1970. In the course of his collecting he was sent two existing collections. One was the Martin Kramer collection, compiled in the 1940s and 1950s by Kramer and sent to Probert by a descendant, Lee Goldberg. The second was the Priscilla Hayward Crago collection, started in the 1930s. The Crago collection included packets from several states, with Probert donating the New York related packets to N-YHS.</p>
            <p>(The above was based on information from Probert's

            <p>The collection remains in the order as presented by the donor. Folder 1 holds what appears to be the original Martin Kramer collection. Folders 2-7 hold the contents of 5 binders, which appear to be the Priscilla Hayward Crago portion.</p>

            <p>The collection includes a variety of sugar packets from New York City and New York State. There are also some artificial sweeteners. Most of the packets indicate a brand of sugar (e.g., Domino’s, River Valley, Jack Frost), but are also distinctive in that they can be linked to a particular venue, event, or other particular context. The earliest appear to date from the 1930s and include packets referring to exhibition buildings at the 1939-40 World’s Fair, including those of Borden’s, F&amp;M Schaefer Brewing, and the YMCA. Other events represented in the collection are the 1964-65 World’s Fair and the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid.</p>
            <p>A variety of establishments are represented by one or more packets. These especially include hotels (e.g., Hotel Helmsley, Algonquin, Nevele Country Club, the Concord, Woodstock Inn &amp; Resort) and restaurants (e.g., Stage Deli , Fraunces Tavern, Nedick’s Coffee Shop, Mamma Leone’s, Sardi’s). Some packets appear to be designed and branded for general distribution by suppliers; these often include imagery such as drawings of ships and New York State landmarks. Packets for miscellaneous institutions also appear, such as the New York Athletic Club, St. Mary’s Hospital (Troy, NY), Station WRGB-NBC, the United Nations, and the Corning Glass Center.</p>
            <p>Images of many of these packets can be found at the web site of the collection's donor;
