            <p>Richard M. Pieronek (1926-2002) was born in Hamtramck, Michigan. He was a World War II veteran and a 1951 graduate of the University of Detroit. He worked for over fifty years as a photographer in the Hamtramck-based family business, Pieronek Studios, which was founded by his father, Paul. Richard Pieronek traveled widely in the United States, including on multiple occasions to New York City. Among these trips was one in 1976 in which Pieronek vacationed with his family in connection with the Bicentennial celebrations.</p>
            <p>(The above note is based principally on Pieronek's obituary in the on-line version of the 
                <emph render="italic">Grosse Point News</emph> of 29 November 2002 and the donor's covering letter of 13 March 2017 with the gift.)</p>

            <p>The collection includes about 1200 color slide transparencies of New York City scenes taken by photographer Dick Pieronek. Almost half of the collection includes scenes from the U.S. bicentennial celebrations in July 1976, including the tall ships in New York Harbor, naval parades, and the visit of England's Queen Elizabeth. Another sizable set includes images from the 1964 World's Fair in Flushing, Queens. Other slides, dating from the 1950s-1960s, depict buildings, street scenes, the Statue of Liberty, Times Square, Broadway (including photos of scenes from plays taken from a distance in the audience), Greenwich Village, the San Gennaro Festival, ships at the city docks, and other subject matter. Some slides are "aerial" views taken from the observatory roof of the World Trade Center in 1976 and the RCA Building in 1962. The collection includes a cd of the slides.</p>
