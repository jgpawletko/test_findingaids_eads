            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>John Alsop King, congressman and twentieth governor of New York, was born at New York City on 3 January 1788, the eldest son of Senator Rufus King (1755–1827) and his wife, Mary (Alsop) King. The younger King was educated in England during his father’s first appointment as United States minister to that country (1796–1803), and was later sent to Paris to learn French.</p>
            <p>Once back in America, the King family settled at Jamaica, Queens. John married Mary Ray (1790–1873) on 3 January 1810. He was admitted to the bar, but his practice was curtailed by the War of 1812, during which he was commissioned a lieutenant of cavalry at New York. After the hostilities John developed an interest in agriculture and cultivated a farm near his father’s estate.</p>
            <p>Second to farming, politics absorbed King’s time. He sat in the New York State Assembly in 1819–1821, and in the New York State Senate in 1823–1825, resigning the latter position to accompany his father to London, where the elder King had once more been appointed minister to the Court of St. James (1825–1826).</p>
            <p>When he returned to America, John Alsop King allied with the anti-Masons, National Republicans, and Whigs. He was sent again to the New York State Assembly in 1832, 1838, and 1840. In 1839 he was a delegate to the Whig national convention, and a decade later went to Congress as a Whig representative from Queens County. In Congress King opposed the Fugitive Slave Bill, arguing for California's admission to the Union as a free state.</p>
            <p>In 1852 King was again delegate to the Whig national convention. At the New York convention of 1855 he moved that the Whig Party rebrand itself “Republican.” He then served as a delegate to the first Republican National Convention in 1856. That year the New York State Republican Convention nominated King for governor. He was elected in November for an uneventful two-year term, 1857–1858, during which he devoted his time to issues of education and canal expansion.</p>
            <p>King retired from public life after his term as governor, only to be appointed a member of the New York delegation to the Peace Conference of 1861 at Washington. Back home in Queens, he was stricken with paralysis while delivering a July Fourth oration to his neighbors in 1867. He died three days later, on July 7, at the age of seventy-nine.</p>
            <p>King’s son, Charles Ray King, MD (1813–1901), edited 
                <emph render="italic">The Life and Correspondence of Rufus King</emph> (1894–1900). Another son, also named John Alsop King (1817–1900), served as president of the New-York Historical Society, 1887–1900.</p>

            <p>The collection contains correspondence, mostly letters received, with some drafts of letters sent, and a few papers, 1834-1866, of Queens County congressman and New York governor John Alsop King. Letters pertain to his interests as a congressman representing Queens County (1849-1851), as New York's twentieth governor (1857-1858), as an official of varied institutions, and particularly to Long Island politics, troubles with Canada in 1838, the legacy of Samuel Jones to support the poor of Oyster Bay and North Hempstead in the 1830s, appointments and patronage, slavery, Long Island railroads, the New York State Agricultural College, the Whig and Republican parties, Kansas troubles, elections and conventions, banks, etc. Included are many letters from Benjamin F. Thompson, Robert Ray, James A. Hamilton, and William Kelly, although the majority are occasional letters from various persons, many of whom were prominent in New York affairs. Additional papers include manuscript notes, clippings, circulars, reports, a manuscript sketch on the Kansas question, Erie Canal Commission reports, etc.</p>
