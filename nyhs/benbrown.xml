            <p>Ben Brown was born Ben Hurwitz in 1921 in the Bronx, New York. He attended the High School of Music and Art in New York and after graduation studied art at the University of Iowa before enlisting in the United States Army in 1942. In 1943, after basic training, he was shipped to North Africa and then to Italy a few months later. During his two years in the service, he kept a record of his experiences by sketching and painting whenever he had the chance.</p>
            <p>Hurwitz changed his name to Brown after the war. He put aside his war sketches but continued to work in the arts as a painter, cartoonist and photographer. In 1995, just two years before his death, his son Joshua Brown convinced him to revisit his wartime drawings. A selection of his work, along with Brown's comments, can be found online on the History Matters website: http://historymatters.gmu.edu/text/s1.html.</p>

                    <p>Drawings are arranged by subject and location, when known. Drawings larger than 6 x 8 3/4 inches are housed separately, listed as Oversize drawings. The series contains work in graphite, charcoal, colored pencil, pen and ink, pastel and watercolor and includes portraits of soldiers, depictions of their daily lives, as well as images of the towns and countryside they passed through in North Africa and Italy. Brown drew his fellow soldiers constantly, sketching them working, traveling, eating, playing cards, drinking, fighting and sleeping. The series contains a large number of sketches aboard a transport ship, showing the cramped quarters that the soldiers endured while at sea. Brown also sketched injured soldiers being treated both in an unidentified hospital and aboard the hospital ship Arcadia. Images of soldiers in North Africa include a small painting of a patisserie in Sidi Bel Abbes. Two children peer in the bakery window while soldiers loiter out front. Brown drew several images of soldiers at play that are especially evocative. He labeled these images with titles like "Hot Dice" and "Jumpin' Jive." "Naples Bout," a small pen and ink sketch, shows a lively group of soldiers watching a boxing match.</p>

                        <p>Oversize drawings range from 6 x 9 inches to 8 x 10 1/2 inches in size and contain work in graphite, pen and ink, pastel, watercolor and acrylic. Included are several North African and Italian landscapes, drawings and paintings of soldiers at work and at play and a number of layouts. One particularly interesting piece, done in acrylic, shows soldiers peering in a bar window. Soldiers inside can be seen drinking and socializing. Layouts include a poem by Elma Dean paired with a sketch of two soldiers; a cautionary drawing of cigarettes and the statement "A Dead Give Away"; and several pages showing sketches and boxes blocked out for text.</p>

                    <p>This series contains two spiral bound sketchbooks filled with graphite, charcoal and pen and ink drawings. The smaller book, approximately 4 x 5 inches in size, has drawings Brown created in Italy in 1944. These sketches illustrate the soldiers' daily lives; reading, playing cards and standing guard. A few landscapes and character studies are included.</p>
                    <p>The larger book, approximately 6 x 9 inches in size, also contains graphite and pen and ink sketches done in Italy in 1944. These sketches show soldiers digging trenches, laying wire, bathing and sleeping. Many are captioned with short descriptions of the scenes. One sketch shows men bathing in a well with a caption that describes the excitement of bathing in cold water under the warm sun. Another image simply labeled "Street of Fear," depicts a dark, rubble filled walkway in an unidentified city. This sketchbook also contains several portraits of Brown's fellow soldiers along with some description of their quirky personalities.</p>
