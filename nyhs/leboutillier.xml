            <p>George Le Boutillier and his wife Isabel were artists living and working in New York City and Ridgefield, Connecticut in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Aditionally, George was part owner of the general store "Le Boutillier Brothers."</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents</head>
            <p>George Le Boutillier and his wife, Isabel Groshon Le Boutillier, were both artists living and working in New York City and Ridgefield Connecticut. George was also part owner of a dry-goods general store named Le Boutillier Brothers.</p>
            <p>There is correspondence to and from George Le Boutillier, who wrote several letters of outrage at the police concerning an incident where a black man was beaten for being at a restaurant in Connecticut and the state police did very little to apprehend or punish the perpetrator. He also wrote a letter to Senator Lodge concerning a Treaty with Columbia regarding its uses of the Panama Canal and another letter to Senator Bonah warning of the dangers of encroachment by the Executive Branch on Legislative powers. There is a memorandum in the collection recounting a local event supporting the Women’s Suffrage Movement. An account book from 1878 of Ada Groshon (Isabel’s mother) that records the spending of an affluent New York City wife and mother is also included.</p>
            <p>The collection includes sketches and paintings, which are presumably by George and/or Isabel, and a folder of family photographs featuring individuals drawing or painting in a rural setting. Also included is a small sketchbook of George Le Boutillier; pasted to the back cover of the sketchbook is a permission form signed by the Secretary of the Department of Public Parks allowing George to “take sketches in the Central and City Parks.” In addition, the collection has a copy of an etching of Boutillier Brothers Fourteenth Street storefront, and other printed material.</p>
