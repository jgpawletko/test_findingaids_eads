    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Ernest Rymer (1908-1986) was born in Ukraine in 1908. He came to the United States when he was still a boy, and his family resided in New York City. Rymer was a union organizer in the 1930s, and during World War II he served in the Navy.</p><p>After the war, Rymer (according to his daughter) worked as the "junior director" of the Jewish People's Fraternal Order (JPFO), part of the International Workers Order (I.W.O.). (This title may indicate that he served as director of the Jewish Young Fraternalists, the youth division of JPFO.) Rymer later served as director of the Jewish People's Fraternal Order, I.W.O. until sometime in the 1950s. Around the same period, Rymer was involved in the campaign to create a State of Israel. He was also a member of the Jewish War Veterans and was founder and chairman of the Great Neck chapter of the New Jewish Agenda.</p><p>Rymer had a career as a draftsman and construction designer. In the 1960s and 1970s, he was treasurer of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 66.</p><p>Rymer died in Manhasset, Long Island, NY in 1986 at age 77.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection consists of around eighty photographs dating from 1929 to the late 1970s, through the majority are from the 1940s and 1950s. The images document the various conferences, demonstrations, performances, and other activities of the Jewish Young Fraternalists, part of the Jewish Peoples Fraternal Order of the International Workers Order (I.W.O), as well as the activities of the general Jewish Peoples Fraternal Order, I.W.O. and the I.W.O. as a larger organization. Many photographs feature Ernest Rymer, which is indicated by the captions on the back of the photographs. The captions also contain other descriptive information about events and individuals.</p><p>To a lesser extent, there are photographs dating from 1929 of the Pioneers Camp at Camp Nitgedaiget, as well as photographs from Camp Wo-Chi-Ca. There are also three photographs unrelated to the I.W.O. which are credited to Joe Hall and depict the unemployed and breadlines in New York City during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Four color snapshots are of an anti-nuclear weapons demonstration in New York City, probably during the late 1970s. Two photographs are portraits of Ernest Rymer, one taken by his cousin, S. Rymer.</p><p>In addition to the photographs, there is also correspondence related to Rymer's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for his records, as well as the federal documents he received in response to his request. The collection includes a plaque awarded to Rymer by the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 66, as well as Rymer's World War II-era Navy uniform, dog tag, and Jewish War Veterans and Navy pins. A number of political and/or commemorative buttons and pins on a variety of topics are also present, including approximately 40 pins, a keychain, and some miscellaneous small artifacts from the Soviet Union.</p>  </scopecontent>
