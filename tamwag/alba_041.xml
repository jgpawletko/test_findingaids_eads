    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection consists of eight letters written from Spain by Fishgold to "folks" (presumably to both his parents, although they were long separated) and his sister Betty. The letters describe his first journey through Spain by train, his training, meetings with friends from home, life in camp and in the front lines, and the beauties of the Spanish scenery.  Many passages convey messages to friends and family at home, ask for letters and packages, inquire about political and trade-union developments, and express concern for the well-being of his family.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>Isidore (Irving) Fishgold (1918-1938) was born in Brooklyn to parents who already had six children from earlier marriages. Irving spent much of his childhood alone with his mother, who separated from her husband, leaving the older children with him.

He graduated from high school and worked at various odd jobs, while becoming deeply involved in radical politics. He soon joined the Young Communist League.
