      <abstract id="aspace_85f9c73eb30b0cf7dba5a4108e99e8cd">Benjamin Leider was the first American
        to be killed while fighting in the Spanish Civil War. He enlisted in the Spanish Loyalist
        air force in September 1936 and was assigned to the squadron at Alcala de Henares just north
        of Madrid. Leider died on February 19, 1937 at Madrid when his airplane was shot down during
        fighting. Leider was born in Russia in 1901 and moved to the United States with his family
        in 1904. He was a newspaper reporter and aerial photographer. This collection contains
        newspaper articles about a memorial service held in his honor, a letter from Benjamin to his
        brother, a pamphlet entitled Ben Leider, American Hero, and other personal
        documentation.</abstract>

      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Benjamin Leider was born in Kishinev, Russia in 1901. Many of his relatives were killed in
        the 1905 Kishinev massacre carried out by the Czarist regime against the Jews in Russia. The
        Leider family was helped by a Christian butcher who hid the family in his home. In 1905, his
        family came to America and settled in Brooklyn where his father worked chipping mortar from
        second-hand bricks. He graduated from Brooklyn Commercial High School where he ran track and
        cross-country, wrestled, and wrote for the school newspaper. Afterwards, he attended City
        College where he wrote for the campus student newspaper. After two years, he transferred to
        the journalism school of the University of Missouri.</p>
      <p>After graduating from college, Ben took a job as a reporter with the New York Graphic where
        he worked for five years. In the late 1920s, Ben became interested in aviation. He borrowed
        money and bought a second-hand plane, became an expert pilot, received his license from the
        Department of Commerce and branched out into aerial photography. In 1930, Leider went to
        work for the New York News Association, a reporting service for the city's newspapers, where
        he covered the miners' strike in Harlan County, Kentucky. From 1932 to 1933 Ben worked on a
        WPA project, studying slum housing and slum clearance - a subject on which he was to become
        expert in while working at the New York Post. He joined the staff of the New York Post in
        1934 as a flying reporter. While working for the New York Post, Benjamin was a charter
        member and an organizer of the New York Newspaper Guild. He also became the first aerial
        picket in labor history. In the Guild's first strike action, against the Long Island Press,
        he painted a huge "Join the Guild" sign on his plane and flew low over the publisher's
        roof.</p>
      <p>Leider enlisted in the Spanish Loyalist air force in September 1936 under the pseudonym
        Jose Lando. He piloted a transport plane that transported officers and arms, flying from
        Valencia to Albacete, Alicante and Madrid. In February 1937, he was sent to combat school
        for special training for fighter pilots. He was assigned to the squadron at Alcala de
        Henares just north of Madrid. Benjamin Leider died on February 19, 1937 in Madrid when his
        airplane was shot down while fighting on the Jarama front. He was the first American to be
        killed while fighting in the Spanish Civil War. A memorial service was held for him in
        August 1938 at Carnegie Hall with 3,000 people in attendance. Speakers at the service
        included his brother D. William Leider; Rockwell Kent, president of the American Artists'
        Union; Carl Radau, president of the New York Newspaper Guild, and Frank O'Flaherty, a
        veteran of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. A children's colony in Eastern Spain, "La Casa Ben
        Leider" - founded to house children orphaned by the Spanish Civil War - was named in his
        honor. In 1938, the children in this colony created a book of drawings for Ben Leider's
        family. He is buried in Mount Hebron Cemetery in Flushing, Queens.</p>
